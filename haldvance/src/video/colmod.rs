/// The GBA allows specifying tile texture data in two ways
/// when in [`Text`] or [`Mixed`] mode:
///
/// * **[`Bit8`]:** Each color index within a background or object is 8 bits. The 8
///   bits index into the full block of colors as if it was a single set of 256
///   elements. Index 0 is counted as the "transparency" index.
///   * `base_addr + size_of::<Color>() * index`
/// * **[`Bit4`]:** Each color index within a background or object is 4 bits. The 4
///   bits within the image data is an entry into a "palette bank" of 16
///   entries. The palette bank used for the BG or OBJ overall is determined by
///   their control bits. Index 0 within a palbank is still considered the
///   "transparency" index.
///   * `base_addr + size_of::<Color>() * (pal_bank << 4 | entry)`
///
/// A series of 32Ã—32 colors represent a [`Tile`], individual tiles are
/// addressed by index in the [SBB](sbb::Handle).
